                <p>
                    I'm currently a 2nd Year Game Development Technology Student at Anglia Ruskin University.
                    I've created this website as a way to display my Portfolio in a modern interactive way.
                    Use the Navigation bar above to view each project and my evaluation of each.

                    I have been playing Video Games for most of my life across various systems such as the Nintendo Systems (DS,Wii,Switch),
                    PlayStations, Xbox's and PC. I enjoy games of all genre however I particularly enjoy the Resident Evil and Elder Scrolls series.
                    I enjoy watching Esports events and E3 and enjoy partaking in discussions and debates about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past 5 years I've developed an interest in Programming and studied a Level 3 in Computing at College and have chosen
                    to continue studying a similar topic in Game Development as it's a combination of 2 topics I like.
                    I specific interest in game AI and enjoy studying how to develop a more immersive experience using various techniques.
                    I also enjoy developing core gameplay systems such as movement or interaction systems.
